Chapter 2.1
    
    functions must be declared before main to be called.
    functions cannot be nested(!)

    when the return statement is executed
        return expression is evaluated to a value
        value is copied back to the caller
        function exits and control returns to caller

    in c++ main()
        must return an int
        cannot be explicitly called anywhere
    
    it is a common misconception that main is always the first function that executes
        global varabels are intialised prior to the execution of main
        IF the initialiser for such a vairable invokes a function, then that function
            will execute prior to main
