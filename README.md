Although I have the basics of C++ down and have created university projects, unreal-engine games and small programs with the language, I want to gain a deeper understanding of everything the language has to offer.

In other words, I feel that I have a shallow understanding of C++ and am going to use this summer as an opportunity to learn all the underlying intricacies of the language - thus I'll be starting from the bottom at chapter 0 of learncpp.com.

It also will keep me programming outside of my summer internship at Google.
